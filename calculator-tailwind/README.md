## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
- Perform mathmatical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference
- Have their initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and have any additional changes saved in the browser

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS variables
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) - React build stack
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I used the project to learn Tailwind CSS. I found Tailwind fairly easy to use and customize, but I probably would just use plain CSS or SASS for another project this small.

It was also a good way to practice the useReducer React hook to implement the logic of the calculator and saving color themes with css variables.
